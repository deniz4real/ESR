# ESR (Engelsiz Seyahat Rehberi) – Map Based Application for Walking Disabled People

ESR is an Android mobile application developed to assist individuals with walking disabilities in navigating urban environments more safely and efficiently.

The application calculates slope percentages for road segments using Google Maps and Google Elevation APIs. Based on this data, it visually evaluates whether a path is accessible for wheelchair users by marking routes with color codes.

This project was developed as a graduation thesis for the Management Information Systems program at Işık University.
